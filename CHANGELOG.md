## [1.5.1] - 2026-02-05

### 🐛 Motion Detection Improvements

Critical fixes for motion detection reliability and debugging.

### Fixed
- **Channel ID Parsing**: Added support for multiple XML tag variants used by different Hikvision NVR models
  - Now supports: `channelID`, `channelId` (lowercase), `dynChannelID`, `inputIOPortID`
  - Fixes "Event missing channelID" errors on some NVR models
- **Event Stream Logging**: Improved diagnostic messages for troubleshooting
  - Full raw XML logging when `debugMotion: true` for malformed events
  - Clear indication of which channel IDs are registered vs received
  - Better error messages for debugging event parsing issues

### Added
- **Enhanced Debug Logging**: When `debugMotion: true`, shows:
  - Event stream connection status with emoji indicators
  - Number of registered camera listeners on startup
  - Complete raw XML for events that fail to parse
  - All received events (including non-motion types) before filtering
  - Listener notification details (which cameras received events)
- **Startup Diagnostics**: Motion event stream now logs:
  - Connection endpoint URL
  - Number of cameras registered for motion events
  - Warning if no cameras are registered
  - Confirmation when event stream receives first data

### Changed
- Motion event parser now tries multiple channel ID tag formats before giving up
- Debug logs now include emoji indicators for better readability
- Error messages provide actionable guidance (e.g., "enable debugMotion to see raw XML")

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive motion detection troubleshooting guide
- Includes manual testing with curl commands
- NVR configuration checklist
- Common issues and solutions

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-04

### 🚀 VAAPI Hardware Acceleration Quality Profiles

Major update adding quality profile system for hardware encoders with optimized GOP sizes for HomeKit streaming.

### Added
- **Quality Profile System**: New UI dropdown for selecting encoding quality (Speed/Balanced/Quality)
- **7 Hardware Encoder Presets**: VAAPI, QuickSync, NVENC, AMF, VideoToolbox, Jetson, RK MPP
- **HomeKit-Optimized GOP Sizes**: Fixed keyframe intervals to 1-2 seconds for reliable streaming
  - Speed: 2 second keyframes (25 frames @ 12.5fps)
  - Balanced: 1.5 second keyframes (19 frames @ 12.5fps)
  - Quality: 1 second keyframes (13 frames @ 12.5fps)

### Fixed
- **VAAPI Filter Chain**: Removed `-color_range mpeg` that caused auto-insertion of CPU scaler
- **HomeKit Stream Stability**: Reduced GOP from 120 to 13-25 frames for better compatibility
- **Frame Rate Detection**: GOP sizes now properly scaled to source framerate
- **VAAPI Parameters**: Changed from unsupported `-b_depth` to `-bf` for B-frames

### Changed
- **Full GPU Pipeline**: Decode → Scale → Encode stays on GPU (80% CPU reduction)
- **Minimal Parameters**: Only universally supported VAAPI options (`-bf`, `-g`)
- **Config Schema**: Added quality profile dropdown in UI

### Performance
- VAAPI Speed profile: ~5% CPU, ~40% GPU utilization
- VAAPI Quality profile: ~10% CPU, ~30% GPU utilization
- No more CPU↔GPU memory transfers

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-28

### 🎉 Production Ready Release
This version makes the plugin ready for public NPM distribution with zero-config setup.

### Added
- **Auto-Save to config.json**: Discovered cameras automatically saved to disk, persisting across restarts
- **Enhanced First-Run Experience**: Helpful emoji-based logging guides users through setup
- **Improved Cleanup Logging**: Clear messages when orphaned accessories are removed
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Better error messages and troubleshooting hints
- **Comprehensive README**: Full documentation for public distribution

### Changed
- **Better Discovery Logging**: More informative messages during camera discovery
- **Enhanced Config Schema**: Improved hardware encoder descriptions with platform guidance
- **Cleaner Config Output**: Pretty-printed JSON with 4-space indentation

### Fixed
- Config persistence across restarts (cameras now saved to config.json)
- Hardware acceleration profiles properly displayed in Homebridge UI

## [1.1.1] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Orphaned accessories now removed BEFORE creating new ones
- **forceDiscovery Warning**: Warns users when forceDiscovery is enabled with existing cameras
- **Better Error Prevention**: Prevents "already bridged" errors during upgrades

### Added
- Comprehensive logging for cleanup operations

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-28

### 🚀 Major Quality & Performance Update

### Fixed
- **Bitrate**: Changed default from 299kbps to 2000kbps for excellent quality
- **Snapshots**: Corrected ISAPI endpoint format (`/ISAPI/Streaming/channels/{channelId}/picture`)
- **Snapshot Format**: Added `-f image2` flag for proper JPEG handling

### Added
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Support for 7 encoder profiles:
  - `software` - CPU encoding (default, works everywhere)
  - `vaapi` - Intel/AMD GPU on Linux
  - `quicksync` - Intel iGPU (all platforms)
  - `nvenc` - NVIDIA GPU (all platforms)
  - `amf` - AMD GPU on Windows
  - `videotoolbox` - Apple Silicon / Intel Mac
  - `v4l2` - Raspberry Pi
- **Enhanced Logging**: Shows generated RTSP URLs, snapshot URLs, and camera settings
- **Encoder Selection**: Automatic encoder preset application based on config

### Performance
- Hardware acceleration reduces CPU usage by 60-90%
- Example: 6 cameras at 1080p@30fps
  - Software encoding: 60-80% CPU
  - NVENC encoding: 5-10% CPU
